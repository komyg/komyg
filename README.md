### About Me

I am a full stack software developer with more than 10 years of experience, and I am currently working as a Founding Engineer in [Plato](https://www.plato.io/).

More recently, I was CTO of Onyo and contributed to its acquisition by Alelo.

### Experience

I have experience both in building distributed systems and microservices and working with monoliths.

I've worked with several technologies such as:

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [Angular](https://angular.io/) on the frontend.
- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/), [Python](https://www.python.org/), [Golang](https://go.dev/) and [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/) in the backend.
- [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/), [GCloud](https://cloud.google.com/) and [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) in the infrastructure side.

### Open Source

I love to make contributions to relevant projects whenever I can. So far, I've contributed with:

- [Typescript](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript)
- [Babel](https://github.com/babel/babel)
- [Date FNS](https://github.com/date-fns/date-fns)
