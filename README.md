### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my personal Github profile.

### About Me

I am a full stack software developer with more than 10 years of experience and I am currently working in [Runa HR](https://runahr.com/mx/home/) as a Tech Lead.

More recently I was CTO of Onyo and contributed to its acquisition by Alelo.

### Experience

I have experience both in building distributed systems and microservices and working with monoliths.

I've worked with several technologies such as:

- React and Angular on the frontend.
- NodeJS, Python and Golang in the backend.
- Kubernetes, GCloud and AWS in the infrastructure side.

### Open Source

I love to make contributions to relevant projects whenever I can. So far I've contributed with:

- [Typescript](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript)
- [Babel](https://github.com/babel/babel)
- [Date FNS](https://github.com/date-fns/date-fns)
